## About This Book

Autistic people are overrepresented in STEAM fields for good reason. The same cognitive traits that define the autistic experience — pattern recognition, deep focus, systematic thinking, attention to detail, and intense curiosity — are exactly what science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics demand.

Yet too often, the environments where STEAM is taught are designed in ways that create unnecessary barriers for autistic learners. Not because the material is wrong for them, but because the delivery is.

This book is for people who already understand autism — from life, not just textbooks. You are parents, teachers, tutors, mentors, or autistic adults navigating your own STEAM education. You do not need a primer on what autism is. What you need are concrete, research-informed strategies for removing barriers and building on strengths in each STEAM domain.

This is not a book about making autistic students tolerate conventional instruction. It is a book about designing instruction that works with autistic cognition, not against it.

## How to Use This Book

Read it in order for a complete picture, or jump to the chapters most relevant to your situation right now. Each STEAM domain chapter (5–9) stands on its own, but the foundational chapters (2–4) provide context that applies across all of them.

Throughout the book, you will find:

- **Research grounding** — citations and references to peer-reviewed work where claims are made
- **Practical strategies** — specific, actionable approaches you can implement
- **Environment design** — how to modify spaces and processes rather than expecting the learner to simply cope
- **Strengths-based framing** — what autistic cognition brings to each domain, not just what it struggles with

## A Note on Language

This book primarily uses identity-first language ("autistic person") because that is what the majority of the autistic community prefers, as documented in research by Bottema-Beutel et al. (2021) and Kenny et al. (2016). We recognize that some individuals and families prefer person-first language ("person with autism"), and neither choice is wrong. Use the language your learner prefers.

When we say "autistic learners," we mean the full spectrum. Autism presents differently across individuals, and no single profile represents everyone. Strategies that work brilliantly for one autistic student may need significant adaptation for another. This book offers a toolbox, not a prescription.
