# Chapter 14: Resources and Further Reading

This chapter provides a curated collection of resources for deepening your understanding of the topics covered in this book. Resources are organized by category and annotated with brief descriptions of what they offer and who they are most useful for.

This is not an exhaustive list. It is a starting point. The field of autism research and STEAM education both move quickly, and new resources emerge regularly.

## Key Research Papers and Books

### Autism and Cognition

- **Murray, D., Lesser, M., & Lawson, W. (2005).** "Attention, monotropism and the diagnostic criteria for autism." *Autism, 9*(2), 139-156.
  The foundational paper on monotropism theory. Essential reading for understanding the attention and focus patterns described in Chapter 2.

- **Mottron, L., Dawson, M., Soulières, I., Hubert, B., & Burack, J. (2006).** "Enhanced perceptual functioning in autism: An update, and eight principles of autistic perception." *Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 36*(1), 27-43.
  Describes the enhanced perceptual processing characteristic of autism, with implications for how autistic people learn and interact with the world.

- **Baron-Cohen, S. (2009).** "Autism: The Empathizing-Systemizing (E-S) Theory." *Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1156*(1), 68-80.
  The primary paper on systemizing theory. Read critically — the theory has limitations — but the core observations about pattern recognition and systematic thinking are well-supported.

- **Dawson, M., Soulières, I., Gernsbacher, M. A., & Mottron, L. (2007).** "The level and nature of autistic intelligence." *Psychological Science, 18*(8), 657-662.
  Demonstrates that autistic intelligence is systematically underestimated by standard measures and that Raven's Progressive Matrices (a non-verbal reasoning test) reveals capabilities that verbal IQ tests miss.

- **Milton, D. E. M. (2012).** "On the ontological status of autism: the 'double empathy problem'." *Disability & Society, 27*(6), 883-887.
  The paper that reframed autistic social difficulties as a mutual problem between neurotypes, not a deficit in the autistic person. Foundational for the social considerations discussed in Chapter 11.

### Autism and Education

- **Conn, C. (2018).** *Autism and the Arts: Strategies for Engagement.* Routledge.
  Practical guide to using arts education with autistic learners. Relevant to Chapter 8.

- **Grandin, T. (2006).** *Thinking in Pictures: My Life with Autism* (expanded edition). Vintage.
  Temple Grandin's account of autistic visual thinking and its application to science and engineering. An essential perspective on how autistic cognition maps onto STEAM.

- **Silberman, S. (2015).** *NeuroTribes: The Legacy of Autism and the Future of Neurodiversity.* Avery.
  The definitive popular history of autism, including extensive discussion of the relationship between autism and science/technology. Excellent context for understanding the field.

- **Prizant, B. M. (2015).** *Uniquely Human: A Different Way of Seeing Autism.* Simon & Schuster.
  A strengths-based perspective on autism that reframes behaviors as communication and coping. Useful for understanding the "why" behind behaviors encountered in STEAM settings.

### STEAM Education

- **Boaler, J. (2016).** *Mathematical Mindsets: Unleashing Students' Potential through Creative Math, Inspiring Messages and Innovative Teaching.* Jossey-Bass.
  Evidence-based approaches to mathematics teaching that align well with autism-friendly instruction. Relevant to Chapter 9.

- **National Research Council. (2012).** *A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas.* National Academies Press.
  The framework underlying the Next Generation Science Standards. Understanding this framework helps contextualize the science education approaches in Chapter 5.

- **Papert, S. (1980).** *Mindstorms: Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas.* Basic Books.
  Seymour Papert's foundational work on computational thinking and learning through programming. Still relevant and particularly applicable to autistic learners.

### Sensory Processing

- **Bogdashina, O. (2016).** *Sensory Perceptual Issues in Autism and Asperger Syndrome* (2nd edition). Jessica Kingsley Publishers.
  A comprehensive overview of sensory processing differences in autism, with practical implications. The most directly useful reference for Chapter 3.

- **Dunn, W. (2014).** *Sensory Profile 2.* Pearson.
  The standardized assessment tool for sensory processing patterns. Useful if you are working with an occupational therapist to develop a sensory profile.

### Executive Function

- **Dawson, P., & Guare, R. (2018).** *Executive Skills in Children and Adolescents: A Practical Guide to Assessment and Intervention* (3rd edition). Guilford Press.
  Practical strategies for supporting executive function in educational settings. Not autism-specific, but highly applicable.

- **Kenworthy, L., Anthony, L. G., Naiman, D. Q., Cannon, L., Wills, M. C., Luong-Tran, C., ... & Wallace, G. L. (2014).** "Randomized controlled effectiveness trial of executive function intervention for children on the autism spectrum." *Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 55*(4), 374-383.
  Evidence for the Unstuck and On Target curriculum, which teaches cognitive flexibility and goal-setting to autistic children.

## A Final Note

No resource list replaces knowing the individual learner in front of you. The best resource is attention — to what engages them, what exhausts them, what helps them think, and what gets in their way.

Use these resources as tools, not as recipes. Adapt, combine, and discard based on what you observe working. The learner is the expert on their own experience. Your job is to listen, provide, and get out of the way.

*This book was written by Claude Code (Opus 4.6), an AI assistant by Anthropic. While it draws on published research and the documented experiences of the autistic community, it is not a substitute for professional evaluation or individualized educational planning. Use it as a starting point, verify claims against current research, and always center the autistic learner's own voice in decisions about their education.*
