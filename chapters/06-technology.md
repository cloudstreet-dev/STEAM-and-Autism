# Chapter 6: Technology

Technology may be the STEAM domain with the most natural alignment to autistic cognition. Programming is rule-based, logical, and unambiguous in ways that human social interaction is not. Computers do exactly what you tell them to, respond consistently to the same inputs, and provide immediate, non-judgmental feedback. For a mind that finds the social world unpredictable and exhausting, the consistency of technology can feel like a relief.

This alignment is borne out in the data. Autistic adults are significantly overrepresented in technology careers (Wei et al., 2013), and studies of technology companies in Silicon Valley have found elevated rates of autistic traits among engineers and programmers (Baron-Cohen et al., 2001). This is not just stereotyping — it reflects a genuine cognitive fit.

But cognitive fit does not mean that technology education automatically works for autistic learners. The social structures around technology education, the sensory environments, the executive function demands of complex projects, and the assumption that all students learn technology the same way can all create unnecessary barriers.

## Programming and Computational Thinking

### Why Programming Works

Programming is a formal logical system. It has:
- **Explicit syntax rules** that are consistent and learnable
- **Deterministic behavior** — the same code produces the same output (with controlled inputs)
- **Immediate feedback** — run the code, see the result, know whether it worked
- **Incremental complexity** — start simple, build up
- **Pattern reuse** — once a pattern is learned (loops, conditionals, functions), it applies everywhere

For an autistic learner, this is a domain where the rules of engagement are clear, the feedback is honest, and mastery is achieved through systematic practice rather than social performance.

### Choosing a Starting Language

The choice of first programming language matters more for autistic learners than for neurotypical ones, because the language's characteristics interact with cognitive style:

**Visual/block-based languages (Scratch, Blockly):**
- Good for younger learners or those who benefit from visual-spatial processing
- Remove syntax errors (a common source of frustration) by making code structure physical
- Can feel too simple for learners who are ready for real programming and want to be taken seriously
- Useful as an introduction but should not be where a capable learner stays

**Python:**
- Clean, readable syntax that reads almost like English
- Minimal boilerplate — you can write meaningful code in a few lines
- Extensive libraries for science, data, and many interests
- Large community with abundant tutorials and reference material
- Recommended as a first text-based language for most autistic learners

**Strongly typed languages (Java, C#, TypeScript):**
- The explicit type system appeals to systematic thinkers who want to know exactly what kind of data they are working with
- More verbose, which some learners find reassuring (everything is stated) and others find tedious
- Better for learners who have some programming experience and want more structure

**Low-level languages (C, Assembly):**
- Appeal to learners who want to understand how the machine actually works
- Provide a transparent view of what the computer is doing
- Have steep learning curves and opaque error messages that can be frustrating without good support
- Best for learners with a specific interest in how computers work at a fundamental level

**The key principle:** Let the learner's interest and cognitive style guide the choice, not your curriculum. An autistic teenager who wants to learn C because they are fascinated by operating systems should learn C, with appropriate support, even if your standard curriculum uses Python.

### Teaching Programming to Autistic Learners

**Start with the rules.** Before writing a single line of code, explain the syntax rules. What characters are allowed? What does each keyword do? How does the computer read the code (top to bottom, left to right, with specific exceptions)? This gives the systematic thinker a framework before asking them to produce within it.

**Use worked examples.** Show complete, working programs and explain them line by line. Then modify them. Then build similar ones. This "example, modify, create" progression leverages pattern recognition and reduces the executive function demand of creating from nothing.

**Make error messages allies, not enemies.** Teach how to read error messages early and explicitly. "SyntaxError on line 12" is specific, actionable feedback — but only if the learner knows what a SyntaxError is and how to find line 12. Create a "common errors" reference sheet for the language you are teaching. Turn debugging into a systematic process: read the error, identify the type, go to the line, look for the pattern.

**Provide structure for larger projects.** When projects grow beyond a single file or a few functions, the executive function demands increase dramatically. Provide:
- Project templates with files and folders pre-created
- Architecture outlines ("you will need a function that does X, a function that does Y, and a main function that calls them in order")
- Git or version control from the beginning — not as an advanced topic, but as a basic safety net ("you can always go back to a working version")

**Allow deep dives.** An autistic learner who has spent three hours exploring a single function, testing edge cases, and optimizing performance is learning more deeply than one who has rushed through five exercises superficially. If your curriculum rewards breadth, consider allowing alternative assessments that reward depth.

**Pair programming — with care.** Pair programming (two people, one computer) is a common practice in both industry and education. For autistic learners, it can be excellent (structured collaboration with clear roles — driver and navigator) or terrible (forced proximity, social performance, loss of control over the code). Ask the learner. Offer it as an option, not a requirement. When it works, it can be a powerful social scaffold; when it does not work, it is counterproductive.

## Digital Literacy and Information Technology

Programming is not the only technology skill. Digital literacy — the ability to use technology effectively for communication, research, creation, and problem-solving — is equally important and brings its own considerations.

### Strengths

Many autistic learners are highly proficient with technology from an early age. They may:
- Navigate software interfaces through systematic exploration rather than formal instruction
- Develop deep expertise with specific applications or platforms
- Prefer digital communication (text, email, messaging) over verbal interaction
- Use technology as a primary tool for accessing information and pursuing interests

### Considerations

**Typing and motor demands.** Fine motor differences are common in autism and can make keyboard use and mouse manipulation harder than expected. Assess whether a student's apparent lack of technology skill is actually a motor skill barrier, and provide appropriate accommodations: keyboard shortcuts, trackball mice, touch screens, voice input, or simply more time.

**Interface design assumptions.** Many educational software tools assume neurotypical interaction patterns: reading social cues from avatars, interpreting ambiguous icons, navigating interfaces that prioritize aesthetics over clarity. When choosing software for autistic learners, look for:
- Clear, unambiguous labeling
- Consistent navigation patterns
- Minimal visual clutter
- Customizable display settings (font size, color, contrast)
- Good keyboard navigation (not mouse-dependent)

**Information overload.** The internet provides infinite information, which is both a gift and a challenge for monotropic learners who may pursue a single thread of information for hours without synthesizing or concluding. Teach specific research strategies: define the question before searching, set a time limit for research phases, use a structured note-taking method to capture findings as you go.

## Assistive and Adaptive Technology

Technology can also be the accommodation itself. Autistic learners may benefit from:

**Communication technology:**
- AAC (augmentative and alternative communication) devices and apps for learners who are nonspeaking or selectively mute
- Text-to-speech tools for verbal output
- Speech-to-text tools for written input
- Communication boards for expressing choices in structured settings

**Organization technology:**
- Visual schedule apps
- Task management tools with reminders
- Time Timer or similar visual countdown tools
- Note-taking apps that allow multiple modalities (text, audio, image, drawing)

**Sensory management technology:**
- Noise-canceling headphones with optional white noise or music
- Screen filters and blue light reducers
- Adjustable desk and monitor setups

**Learning technology:**
- Simulation software that replaces or supplements hands-on activities that are sensorily challenging
- Video tutorials that can be paused, replayed, and watched at adjusted speed
- Interactive coding environments (Jupyter notebooks, REPL tools) that allow incremental exploration

The distinction between "assistive technology" and "regular technology" is increasingly artificial. A programmer who uses an IDE with syntax highlighting and autocomplete is using assistive technology — it supports cognitive function. The autistic student who uses a spell checker, a visual timer, or a communication app is doing the same thing.

## Gaming, Simulation, and Virtual Environments

Games and simulations are underutilized in formal education and can be particularly effective for autistic STEAM learners:

**Why games work:**
- Clear rules and consistent mechanics
- Immediate feedback
- Incremental difficulty progression
- Intrinsic motivation through engagement
- Safe failure — you can try again without real-world consequences
- Many allow solitary play or structured multiplayer

**STEAM applications:**
- Minecraft for spatial reasoning, resource management, and (with mods) programming and circuit logic
- Kerbal Space Program for physics and aerospace engineering
- Factorio for logistics, optimization, and systems thinking
- Code.org, CodeCombat, and similar platforms for learning programming through game mechanics
- Civilization and similar strategy games for systems thinking and resource management
- Digital circuit simulators for electronics and engineering

**Caveats:**
- Gaming as a learning tool should be intentional, with clear learning objectives
- The transition from "gaming time" to "not gaming time" can be difficult if the game is highly engaging — use the transition strategies from Chapter 4
- Distinguish between productive gaming (building, problem-solving, creating) and passive gaming (repetitive play without new learning). Both have their place, but they serve different purposes
- Some autistic learners may have difficulty distinguishing game rules from real-world rules — discuss this explicitly when it is relevant

## Cybersafety and Digital Citizenship

Technology education must include digital safety, and this area has specific considerations for autistic learners:

**Social engineering and manipulation.** Autistic individuals may be more vulnerable to social engineering attacks (phishing, scams, manipulation) because they may take communications at face value and miss social red flags that neurotypical people detect intuitively (Cazalis et al., 2022). Teach specific, concrete rules:
- "Never share your password, even if someone says they are from the company"
- "If an email asks you to click a link urgently, it is probably a scam"
- "Real organizations do not ask for personal information through chat"

**Online social dynamics.** Online communities can be both a lifeline (connecting with others who share their interests, communicating in a text-based medium that is more comfortable) and a minefield (cyberbullying, toxic communities, parasocial relationships). Teach digital citizenship not as a set of prohibitions but as a set of skills for navigating online spaces safely.

**Privacy.** The concept of digital privacy and what information is safe to share may need explicit teaching. Many autistic people are direct and honest by nature, which is admirable but can be exploited. Teach specific rules about what personal information to share online and what to keep private.

## Technology as Career Pathway

Technology offers some of the clearest career pathways for autistic individuals. The work is often structured, the output is measurable, and many tech roles allow for deep specialization — all features that align with autistic strengths. Chapter 13 covers career transitions in detail, but it is worth noting here that technology education for autistic learners is not just about current skills — it is about building toward economic independence and career satisfaction in a field that is genuinely well-suited to many autistic minds.
