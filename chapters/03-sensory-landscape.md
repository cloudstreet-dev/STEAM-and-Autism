# Chapter 3: The Sensory Landscape of STEAM Environments

Sensory processing differences are not a side effect of autism. They are a core feature, recognized in the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria since 2013, and reported as one of the most impactful daily-life experiences by autistic people themselves (Crane et al., 2009). For STEAM education, sensory processing is not a peripheral concern to be addressed with a quiet room and some earplugs. It is a fundamental design consideration that affects whether an autistic learner can learn at all in a given environment.

This chapter addresses the sensory dimensions of STEAM learning spaces and provides practical strategies for making those spaces workable.

## Understanding Sensory Processing in Autism

Sensory differences in autism are not simply "being more sensitive." The research describes several distinct patterns that can co-occur within the same individual (Dunn, 1997; Ben-Sasson et al., 2009):

**Hypersensitivity (over-responsiveness):** Sensory input registers at a higher intensity than it does for most people. A fluorescent light that is merely present for a neurotypical student is an aggressive, flickering intrusion for a hypersensitive one. A lab chemical that smells faintly to most people is overwhelming. The hum of a computer is not background noise — it is foreground noise competing with the teacher's voice.

**Hyposensitivity (under-responsiveness):** Some sensory channels may register input at lower intensity, leading to sensory seeking behavior. A student who appears to not notice they have cut themselves during a lab, or who constantly touches materials and textures, or who seeks out deep pressure by leaning against furniture, may be hyposensitive in those channels.

**Both at once:** The same individual can be hypersensitive in some channels (e.g., auditory) and hyposensitive in others (e.g., proprioceptive). And sensitivity levels can fluctuate based on stress, fatigue, hunger, and cumulative sensory load throughout the day.

**Sensory discrimination difficulties:** Even when the intensity of sensation is not the issue, the ability to distinguish and interpret sensory signals may be affected. This can make it hard to pick out a teacher's voice from background noise, or to interpret the tactile feedback from a tool.

## The Concept of Sensory Load

Think of sensory tolerance as a budget. Every sensory input costs something. A learner arrives at a STEAM class having already spent sensory currency on the bus ride, the crowded hallway, the cafeteria at lunch, the fire alarm that went off during second period. By the time they reach your lab or classroom, their remaining budget may be small.

This explains why a student can handle the same environment on Monday and have a crisis in it on Thursday. The environment did not change. The budget they arrived with did.

**Implication:** Sensory accommodations are not about eliminating all sensory input. They are about reducing unnecessary sensory costs so the learner has enough budget left for the sensory demands that are actually part of the learning task.

## Sensory Challenges by STEAM Domain

### Science Labs

Science laboratories are among the most sensorily demanding educational environments:

- **Chemical odors** — volatile chemicals can be overwhelming for olfactory-sensitive students, even within safety limits that are comfortable for most people
- **Fluorescent lighting** — standard in most labs, these lights flicker at frequencies that many autistic people can perceive even though most neurotypical people cannot
- **Equipment noise** — fume hoods, centrifuges, autoclaves, and other equipment generate continuous noise
- **Tactile demands** — handling specimens, chemicals, and equipment involves unpredictable textures
- **Protective equipment** — goggles, lab coats, and gloves create their own sensory experience (tight elastic, unfamiliar textures, restricted vision)
- **Temperature** — labs may be unusually warm or cold, and experiments may involve heat sources
- **Visual clutter** — labs full of equipment, labeled containers, and safety signage create a visually busy environment

### Technology Spaces

Computer labs and tech spaces present a different sensory profile:

- **Screen glare and brightness** — extended screen time with fluorescent overhead lighting creates visual strain
- **Keyboard and mouse noise** — in a room full of students typing, the cumulative click-clack can be significant
- **HVAC noise** — server rooms and well-cooled computer labs often have louder ventilation
- **Chair discomfort** — standard classroom chairs are not designed for extended seated work
- **Electromagnetic sensitivity** — while controversial in the general population, some autistic individuals report awareness of electronic humming from monitors and equipment

### Engineering and Maker Spaces

These can be the most intense environments:

- **Power tool noise** — even with hearing protection, the vibration and sudden noise from saws, drills, and 3D printers can be overwhelming
- **Material textures** — wood, metal, plastic, clay, wire, solder — engineering involves constant tactile engagement with varied materials
- **Adhesive and soldering fumes** — hot glue, solder flux, laser cutter emissions, and paint all generate odors
- **Dust and particulates** — sanding, cutting, and printing generate airborne particles
- **Unpredictable sensory events** — things break, fall, make unexpected noises, and create sudden visual events

### Arts Spaces

Often overlooked as sensorily demanding:

- **Paint, clay, and adhesive textures** — many art materials are wet, sticky, gritty, or otherwise tactilely challenging
- **Music and performing arts** — volume, crowding, stage lights, costume textures, and audience noise
- **Open floor plans** — art rooms often lack the defined spatial boundaries that help autistic learners feel contained
- **Material smells** — paint, turpentine, fixative sprays, kiln-fired ceramics

### Mathematics Classrooms

Generally the least sensorily demanding, but not neutral:

- **Standard classroom issues** — fluorescent lights, HVAC noise, chair discomfort, hallway noise
- **Whiteboard/marker smells** — dry-erase markers have a distinct chemical odor
- **Visual complexity** — boards covered in dense notation can be visually overwhelming
- **Peer noise** — "collaborative learning" environments where students are expected to discuss math can be acoustically chaotic

## Practical Strategies for Sensory-Friendly STEAM Environments

### Lighting

Fluorescent lighting is the single most commonly reported environmental barrier by autistic individuals in educational settings (Bogdashina, 2016).

- **Replace fluorescent tubes with LED panels** where possible — they do not flicker
- **Offer a seat near natural light** and away from overhead fixtures
- **Allow tinted glasses or brimmed hats** — these are accommodations, not dress code violations
- **Use task lighting** (desk lamps) instead of overhead lighting when possible
- **Reduce visual clutter** on walls and surfaces — every poster and display adds to visual processing load

### Sound

- **Allow noise-canceling headphones or earplugs** during independent work
- **Provide advance warning** of loud events (fire drills, equipment startup, alarm tests)
- **Offer a quiet workspace option** — even a corner with a divider reduces ambient noise
- **Use visual timers** instead of auditory alarms for timed activities
- **Be aware of background noise** you have habituated to (HVAC, equipment hum, hallway noise) — the autistic learner has not habituated to it
- **In maker spaces,** schedule noisy and quiet activities in separate blocks rather than running them simultaneously

### Touch and Texture

- **Offer alternatives** when materials are tactilely aversive — nitrile gloves instead of latex, tools with padded grips, alternatives to clay or paint when the concept can be learned other ways
- **Do not force handling of textures** that provoke a strong aversion response — this is not "getting used to it," it is a sensory assault that prevents learning
- **Allow fidget tools** that provide acceptable tactile input during instruction
- **Be thoughtful about required clothing** — lab coats and goggles are safety requirements, but offer choices where possible (coats in different materials, goggles vs. safety glasses)

### Smell

- **Ventilate** — this helps everyone, but it is critical for olfactory-sensitive students
- **Give advance notice** when activities will involve strong odors
- **Offer scent-free alternatives** where they exist (low-odor markers, alternative chemicals)
- **Allow the student to step out briefly** if an odor becomes overwhelming — a two-minute break is better than a forty-minute shutdown
- **Avoid wearing perfume or scented products** when working with an olfactory-sensitive student

### Space and Movement

- **Provide a defined personal workspace** — clear boundaries around "my space" reduce anxiety
- **Allow movement breaks** — standing, pacing, or stepping out briefly
- **Offer seating choices** — standing desks, balance cushions, or simply the option to stand
- **Reduce crowding** — if a lab has 30 stations but only 20 students, let an autistic student use a station with empty neighbors
- **Create a low-stimulation retreat space** within or near the learning environment — not as punishment or separation, but as a regulation tool the student can access voluntarily

## Creating a Sensory Profile

For learners you work with regularly, develop a sensory profile collaboratively. This is not a clinical assessment — it is a practical document created with the learner's input.

A useful sensory profile for STEAM contexts includes:

1. **Sensitivities by channel:** What are the specific sensory inputs that create the most difficulty? (Be specific — not just "noise," but "sudden loud noise" vs. "continuous low hum" vs. "overlapping voices")
2. **Sensory seeking behaviors:** What sensory input does the learner actively seek? (This often provides clues about what helps regulation)
3. **Early warning signs:** What does it look like when sensory load is building? (Stimming increase, verbal shutdown, irritability, physical withdrawal)
4. **Effective strategies:** What has worked in the past? (Headphones, breaks, specific seat locations, fidgets, movement)
5. **STEAM-specific triggers:** What aspects of the specific learning environment are most challenging?

Build this profile with the learner, not about them. Even young or minimally speaking learners can often indicate preferences if given appropriate choices. An occupational therapist can help develop this profile if the learner already has one.

## Sensory Considerations Are Not Optional

It is tempting to treat sensory accommodations as extras — nice-to-haves after the "real" accommodations (extra time, modified assignments) are in place. This is backwards.

A student in sensory distress cannot learn. Period. It does not matter how well-designed the lesson is, how appropriate the difficulty level, or how perfectly matched to their interests. If the fluorescent light is triggering a migraine, or the lab smells are nauseating, or the noise level has pushed them past their regulation threshold, the learning has stopped. Everything after that point is endurance, not education.

Sensory accommodations are not about comfort. They are about access. They are the ramp to the building. Without them, the door might as well be locked.
