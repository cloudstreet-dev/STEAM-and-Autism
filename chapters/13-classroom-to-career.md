# Chapter 13: From Classroom to Career

STEAM education is not an end in itself. For autistic learners, it is a pathway — to higher education, to meaningful work, to economic independence, and to a life built around their strengths and interests. This chapter addresses the transition from education to career, including post-secondary pathways, workplace considerations, self-advocacy, and the particular opportunities and challenges that autistic people face in STEAM professions.

## The Employment Reality

The employment statistics for autistic adults are sobering. Depending on the study and the population, unemployment and underemployment rates for autistic adults range from 50% to over 85% (Roux et al., 2015; National Autistic Society, 2016). These numbers exist not because autistic people lack skills, but because the hiring process, workplace environment, and social expectations of most workplaces create barriers that have nothing to do with job performance.

STEAM fields offer a better picture, but not a perfect one. Autistic adults in STEAM careers report higher employment rates, higher job satisfaction, and better person-job fit than autistic adults in other fields (Wei et al., 2013). But they still face barriers: the interview process, office politics, open-plan offices, ambiguous expectations, and social norms that are baked into workplace culture.

The goal of this chapter is practical: how to help autistic STEAM learners navigate the transition to post-secondary education and employment with the best possible outcomes.

## Post-Secondary Education

### Choosing a Program

The choice of post-secondary program is one of the most consequential decisions for an autistic STEAM student. Key considerations:

**Academic fit:** Does the program teach content aligned with the student's interests and strengths? A student who loves marine biology will be more successful in a marine biology program than in a generic biology program, even if the latter is "more prestigious."

**Environmental fit:** What does the campus look like? How are classes structured? What are the housing options? Is the campus urban (more stimulation, more anonymity) or rural (less stimulation, less anonymity)? A campus visit — with specific attention to sensory environment and daily logistics — is essential.

**Support services:** Does the institution have disability services? How responsive and knowledgeable are they about autism specifically? Some universities have autism-specific support programs (e.g., Bellevue College's Autism Spectrum Navigators program, Marshall University's College Program for Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder) that provide structured support without segregation.

**Program structure:** Highly structured programs with clear requirements, defined course sequences, and explicit expectations are generally more accessible than flexible programs that require students to navigate choices independently. This is not about limiting options — it is about reducing executive function demands in the program structure so the student can focus on the academic content.

**Size:** Class size matters. A 20-person seminar and a 400-person lecture hall present very different experiences. Neither is inherently better — some autistic students prefer the anonymity of a large lecture, while others prefer the predictability of a small class. Consider the individual.

### Navigating the Transition

The transition from secondary to post-secondary education involves simultaneous changes in academic demands, living situation, social environment, routine, and support structure. Each of these changes is manageable alone; all at once, they can be overwhelming.

**Start the transition early.** In the year before post-secondary education begins:
- Visit the campus multiple times to build familiarity
- Meet with disability services to register accommodations
- Establish routines that will transfer (morning routine, study habits, self-care habits)
- Practice living skills that will be needed (laundry, cooking, grocery shopping, transportation)
- Identify the specific supports that will be available and how to access them

**Reduce the number of simultaneous changes.** If possible:
- Start with a reduced course load (three courses instead of five) and increase once the adjustment is made
- Live at home for the first semester if the campus is close, or arrive early for orientation
- Keep some existing routines and support structures intact while building new ones

**Build a support map.** Before classes begin, identify:
- Where disability services is and how to contact them
- Where to go when overwhelmed (a quiet space, a library, a specific building)
- Who to contact for academic questions (advisor, department administrator)
- What the daily routine will look like (class times, meal times, study times, free time)
- What happens if something goes wrong (who to call, what the procedure is)

### Academic Accommodations in Higher Education

In most countries, post-secondary institutions are legally required to provide reasonable accommodations for documented disabilities. Common accommodations for autistic STEAM students include:

- Extended time on exams and assignments
- A quiet, separate space for exams
- Permission to record lectures
- Note-taking support (provided notes or a peer note-taker)
- Advance access to lecture materials (slides, readings)
- Flexible attendance policies (when attendance is not essential to the learning objective)
- Alternative assessment formats (as discussed in Chapter 12)
- Priority course registration (to build an optimal schedule)
- Single-occupancy housing

**Important:** Accommodations are not automatic. The student must self-identify, provide documentation, and request specific accommodations through the institution's disability services office. Self-advocacy is required, and it should be practiced before it is needed. See the self-advocacy section below.

### Lab and Fieldwork in Higher Education

STEAM programs at the post-secondary level often involve intensive lab, studio, or fieldwork that creates sensory and executive function challenges beyond the classroom:

- Graduate-level labs may involve long hours with little structure
- Research groups have social dynamics that can be opaque
- Fieldwork may involve unpredictable environments, travel, and disrupted routines
- Studio arts programs may require extended open work time in shared spaces

**Strategies:**
- Discuss lab/field/studio accommodations specifically with disability services — these are often overlooked
- Negotiate structure within flexible environments: set your own schedule, create your own procedures, build routine where the program does not provide it
- Communicate with supervisors and advisors about your needs early and directly

## Entering the Workforce

### The Hiring Process

The standard hiring process in many STEAM fields — resume, cover letter, phone screen, technical interview, behavioral interview, team fit interview — is designed around neurotypical social norms. Each step can create barriers:

**Resumes and cover letters:** These are learnable formats. Teach them as templates with specific rules for what to include, how to organize information, and what tone to use. Review specific examples from the STEAM field the student is entering.

**Phone screens:** Phone calls strip away visual information and add auditory processing demands. Request alternatives when possible: video call (which adds visual information) or email/text exchange (which removes real-time processing demands). Many companies are willing to accommodate this if asked.

**Technical interviews:** These are often the best part of the process for autistic candidates because they assess actual STEAM skills. Preparation helps:
- Practice coding interviews (LeetCode, HackerRank) or technical problem-solving in the relevant format
- Learn the format of the interview before it happens (whiteboard, live coding, take-home project)
- Ask for the questions or topics in advance when possible
- Request to type rather than use a whiteboard if motor skills or handwriting are a concern

**Behavioral interviews:** "Tell me about a time when..." questions require retrieving specific episodic memories, constructing a narrative, and presenting it in a socially skilled way. This is a significant barrier for many autistic people. Strategies:
- Prepare specific stories in advance using the STAR format (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
- Practice telling these stories until they feel rehearsed and comfortable
- It is acceptable to say "I prepared an example for this" — preparation is a strength, not a weakness

**"Culture fit" and team interviews:** These are the most subjective and most biased parts of the hiring process. They are also where autistic candidates are most likely to be unfairly screened out. There is no easy fix for this. Strategies:
- Research the company culture beforehand and prepare to demonstrate alignment with stated values
- Be honest about your work style: "I do my best work with clear specifications and uninterrupted focus time"
- Some companies explicitly value neurodiversity (see below) — prioritize these when possible

### Autism-Affirming Employers

A growing number of technology and STEAM companies have neurodiversity hiring programs:

- **SAP** — Autism at Work program, one of the earliest and largest
- **Microsoft** — Neurodiversity Hiring Program with modified interview processes
- **JPMorgan Chase** — Autism at Work initiative
- **EY (Ernst & Young)** — Neuro-Diverse Centres of Excellence
- **Dell Technologies** — Neurodiversity Hiring Program
- **Google, Amazon, and others** — various neurodiversity initiatives

These programs typically modify the interview process (longer evaluations, skill-based assessment rather than behavioral interviewing, workplace previews), provide onboarding support, and create workplace accommodations. They are not charity — they are businesses that have discovered that autistic employees bring specific, valuable strengths to STEAM work.

### Self-Employment and Freelancing

Self-employment can be an excellent option for autistic STEAM professionals because it allows control over:
- Work environment (lighting, noise, temperature, location)
- Schedule (work when you are most productive, not when the office is open)
- Social demands (choose clients, communicate via preferred methods)
- Focus (specialize deeply in an area of interest)

STEAM fields with strong freelance markets include: software development, web design, graphic design, data analysis, technical writing, scientific illustration, music production, and consulting in many technical areas.

**Challenges of self-employment:**
- Finding clients requires marketing and networking (which can be social barriers)
- Managing finances, invoicing, and business operations requires executive function
- Isolation can be a problem if all social contact is removed
- Irregular income creates uncertainty

**Strategies:**
- Start freelancing while still employed or in school to build a client base before depending on it
- Use online freelancing platforms (Upwork, Fiverr, Toptal) that provide structure for finding clients
- Hire or partner with someone who handles the business and social aspects while you do the STEAM work
- Join co-working spaces or online communities for freelancers to maintain social connection

## Workplace Accommodations

In STEAM workplaces, common accommodations include:

**Environmental:**
- A private office or workspace (not open plan)
- Noise-canceling headphones as standard equipment
- Control over lighting (no overhead fluorescents, use task lighting)
- Permission to work from home some or all of the time
- A quiet room available for breaks

**Communication:**
- Written communication preference (email/chat over verbal meetings)
- Agendas provided before meetings
- Clear, written expectations and deadlines
- Direct feedback (not hints or implications)
- Reduced meeting load

**Work structure:**
- Flexible scheduling (core hours rather than fixed 9-5)
- Clear task prioritization from management
- Written procedures for recurring tasks
- Reduced interruptions during focused work
- Permission to specialize rather than generalize

**Social:**
- Exemption from optional social events without penalty
- Structured onboarding rather than "figure it out"
- A designated point of contact for questions
- Clear organizational charts and reporting structures

## Self-Advocacy

Self-advocacy — the ability to understand your own needs and communicate them effectively — is the most important transition skill for autistic STEAM learners. It is not a personality trait. It is a learnable skill set.

### What Self-Advocacy Involves

1. **Self-knowledge:** Understanding your own strengths, challenges, sensory needs, communication preferences, and what you need to do your best work
2. **Communication:** Being able to explain these needs clearly to others (professors, employers, colleagues)
3. **Rights knowledge:** Understanding what accommodations you are entitled to and how to request them
4. **Strategy:** Knowing when to advocate, to whom, and how to frame requests effectively

### Teaching Self-Advocacy

**Start with self-knowledge.** Help the learner identify and articulate their own profile:
- "What kind of environment helps you focus?"
- "What makes it hard for you to do your best work?"
- "What accommodations have helped you in the past?"
- "How do you prefer to communicate?"

**Practice disclosure.** Disclosure — telling someone you are autistic — is a personal decision that should always be the individual's choice. But if the learner chooses to disclose, they should have practiced how:
- When to disclose (before the need for accommodation arises, not after a crisis)
- What to say (focus on what you need, not on a medical explanation: "I work best in a quiet environment with clear written instructions" rather than "I have autism which means I have sensory processing disorder and executive dysfunction")
- Who to tell (disability services, HR, direct supervisors — not necessarily everyone)

**Role-play advocacy conversations.** Practice asking for accommodations in realistic scenarios:
- "Professor, I registered with disability services and my accommodations include extended time on exams. How should I arrange that for your class?"
- "I do my best work with written task specifications rather than verbal instructions. Could you email me the details of what you need?"
- "I noticed the team is planning an open office move. I need a quieter workspace to be productive. Can we discuss options?"

**Build from small to large.** Start with low-stakes advocacy (asking a teacher for a different seat) and build toward higher-stakes situations (requesting workplace accommodations from an employer).

## The Disclosure Decision

Whether to disclose an autism diagnosis in educational or professional settings is a deeply personal decision with real consequences in both directions:

**Reasons to disclose:**
- Formal access to accommodations (usually requires documentation)
- Colleagues and supervisors can understand and respond to your needs
- Reduces the burden of masking and hiding difficulties
- May connect you with neurodiversity networks and mentorship

**Reasons not to disclose:**
- Discrimination is illegal but still happens
- May change how others perceive your competence
- May result in unwanted assumptions ("you don't look autistic," or conversely, reduced expectations)
- Privacy is a right

**A middle path:** Disclose needs without disclosing diagnosis. "I work best with written instructions" does not require explaining why. "I need a quiet workspace" does not require a diagnosis. Many autistic professionals operate this way successfully, requesting what they need in terms of work preferences rather than medical accommodations.

There is no right answer. The decision depends on the individual, the environment, and the specific situation. What matters is that the learner understands their options and feels empowered to make the choice.

## The Long View

The transition from STEAM education to STEAM career is not a single event. It is a process that unfolds over years, with setbacks and breakthroughs, wrong turns and discoveries.

Some autistic STEAM professionals find their footing quickly and build successful careers early. Others take longer, trying multiple paths before finding the right fit. Both trajectories are normal. The unemployment statistics are real, but so are the success stories — and the successes are increasingly common as workplaces become more knowledgeable about neurodiversity and as autistic professionals build communities of mutual support.

The foundation you are building now — STEAM knowledge, self-advocacy skills, self-knowledge, and the confidence that comes from being good at something you care about — is what makes the transition possible. It may not make it easy. But it makes it possible, and possible is where every successful career begins.
